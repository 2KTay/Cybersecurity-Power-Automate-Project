# Cybersecurity-Power-Automate-Project

## Overview
This project automates the process of comparing two files using **Microsoft Power Automate** and **Power BI**, ensuring seamless data accuracy and efficient workflow automation. The solution was developed as part of an **Information Technology Internship at Blackmore Partners Inc**, where automation plays a key role in streamlining IT operations and cybersecurity analysis.

## Features
1. **File Comparison with Power Automate:**
   - Automates the comparison of two structured data files.
   - Detects differences and discrepancies in datasets.
   - Generates a report highlighting the mismatched records.

2. **Data Visualization with Power BI:**
   - Loads and processes the comparison results.
   - Provides interactive dashboards for deeper analysis.
   - Ensures transparency in data validation processes.

## Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Power Automate** (for automation workflows)
- **Microsoft Power BI** (for visualization & reporting)
- **Access to cloud storage or local file system**

## Usage
### Power Automate Workflow:
1. Upload two data files to a designated storage location.
2. Power Automate triggers an automated comparison process.
3. A report is generated highlighting changes and inconsistencies.
4. The processed data is sent to Power BI for analysis.

### Power BI Analysis:
1. Import the comparison results into Power BI.
2. Use pre-built dashboards to analyze discrepancies.
3. Export insights for IT auditing and data validation.

## Contribution to Blackmore Partners Inc.
 I contributed to **automating data comparison workflows** using Power Automate and Power BI. This project:
1. **Improves cybersecurity analysis** by ensuring data integrity.
2. **Reduces manual effort** in comparing large datasets.
3. **Enhances IT infrastructure** by streamlining data validation processes.

## Issues & Future Enhancements
- Improve the automation logic to handle unstructured data.
- Optimize Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Expand compatibility to support additional file formats.
